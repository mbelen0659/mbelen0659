### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Good financial management is essential and effective for people's and organization's financial health and long-term success.

My professional career is extensive in listening to the voice of the customer. I have spent 10+ years in customer service. I have managed complex business situations, including critical financial advisory. I excel when working in business environments that need to solve financial problems.

My experience has formed my character and allowed me to demonstrate my core capabilities: 
Organization, persistence, resilience, relationship management, and critical thinking describe me the best.

I am passionate about how financial decisions impact lives and long-term business results. 

My three-year plan includes becoming a financial advisor for high-profile clients. My education at FGCU will prepare me for a long career in helping people manage their money successfully.

Today, I am interested in contributing to roles related to financial advisory, financial planning, finance operations, and risk management. Helping others achieve their financial freedom.
