### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


As a Finance undergraduate, I bring practical experience with critical financial tools/softwares such as Excel, Tableau, SQL, Envision, and Emoney, developed through hands-on roles in financial settings. My leadership experience and ability to influence across all organizational levels complement my strong attention to detail and time management skills. With a passion for innovative financial strategies, I am eager to join a dynamic financial team, ready to leverage data-driven insights and strategic thinking to impact global financial strategies and drive meaningful business results.
